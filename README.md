Case: building a machine learning model for a [Russian job portal](https://trudvsem.ru/) to predict salaries based on candidates' skills.

Ideas and results are presented in the following [slides](presentation.pdf)

## Code
`feature_encoding` contains the code for a step-by-step preprocessing of raw data.
`feature_generation` provides the code for creating new features.
`model` contains a jupyter notebook for building a final ML model with XGBoost.
`scraping` contains the code used to parse websites for additional data to enhance the model performance.
